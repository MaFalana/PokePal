# PokePal

## Description

Conception: 07/29/23
Started Development: 07/29/23

`PokePal` is a more specialized version of my [GameBuddy]() project. The intent was to create another browser based emulator however this one would specifically run pokemon games ranging from generations one to three, because the also happen to be Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. 

- **Note:** This project uses the USA/Europe version of the aforementioned games

I know that I would have to use an emulator core like VBA-M or mGBA, but how would I implement PKHex in it as well?

### Features

- **Save file Import/Export:** Save data can be downloaded/imported for specific games

- **PKHeX Integration:** PKHeX is a pokemon save editor

- **Cheats:** Cheats can be toggled


### What I Learned

Throughout the development of `PokePal`, several valuable lessons were learned:

- **Emulator Cores:**

- **Rom Loading:**

- **Input Handling:**

- **Integrating mGBA:**

Use WebSocket or other communication protocols to enable real-time interaction between the frontend and backend


## Compiling


## Future Improvements

GameBuddy has a lot of potential for further enhancements and features. Here are some ideas for future improvements:

- **Compatibility with other browsers:**

- **Controller/Gamepad Capabilities:**
